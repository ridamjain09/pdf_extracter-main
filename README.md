Document Processing:

Process 10 PDF files to extract text.
Split each document into sections like paragraphs or pages.
Information Extraction & Tagging:

Extract equipment name, domain (electronics, mechanical, etc.), model numbers, and manufacturer for each section.
Vector Database Integration:

Implement a vector database like Pinecone.

Design a query system that takes user input, extracts the relevant entities (equipment, model, manufacturer), converts the query into vectors, and retrieves relevant sections.
Response Generation:

Use a language model (e.g., GPT-3/4) to generate informative responses based on retrieved sections.
